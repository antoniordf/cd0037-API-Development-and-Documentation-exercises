    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### API Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The bookshelf API was created to allow users to keep track of their favourite books as well as rate each book. Users are able to add books to a list as well as what rating they give to that book. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Bookshelf API follows the REST architecture. Our API has resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Base URL\n",
    "http://127.0.0.1:5000/\n",
    "\n",
    "# Errors\n",
    "Bookshelf uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Bookshelf's server.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Handling\n",
    "Errors are returned as JSON objects in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {\n",
    "    \"success\": False,\n",
    "    \"error\": 400,\n",
    "    \"message\": \"bad request\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Error Types\n",
    "Errors in the Bookshelf API fall into 3 categories:\n",
    "1- not_found: When the resource you are looking for does not exist.\n",
    "2- unprocessable: When the request cannot be processed.\n",
    "3- bad_request: When something is wrong with the request being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Error Code /         Description\n",
    "200-OK:              Everything worked as expected.\n",
    "400-Bad Request:     The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.\n",
    "404-Not Found:       The requested resource doesn't exist.\n",
    "422-Unprocessable:   It was not possible to process the request.\n",
    "\n",
